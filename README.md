Processing Teaching Sketches
================

Sketches created for teaching students Processing (and, by extension, Java) plus more advanced topics-based examples.

\- \- \-

####Basics
Examples created for first-time programmers. Basic program structure, variables, drawing shapes, etc.

####Advanced Topics
Lots of random but more advanced examples. Fancier iteration examples, creating files, sorting ArrayList and PVectors, etc.

####Utilities
Lots of useful bits for lower-level programming. Formatting numbers and strings, file manipulation, run Unix commands, etc.

####3D
Most math-related examples for working in 3D. Finding the normal of a triangle, incremental 3D rotation, flatten a triangle, etc.

####Collision Detection
Collision detection examples [moved to their own repo](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection)

####Data Visualization
Basic examples for working with data. Loading data from file and web in a variety of formats, HTML scraping, force directed graphs, etc.

####Design and Typography
Graphic design and type-related examples. Gradients, parallel lines, drawing text on a circle.

####Mapping
Map-specific examples for reading KLM files, GPS position, etc.

####Image Processing and OpenCV
Examples for working with images and computer vision. Histograms, contrast adjustment,  OpenCV examples, seam carving, posterization, etc.

####Interaction and Games
Lots of game and interaction examples. Game structure, chase and flee behavior, aiming with basic trig, gravity, etc.

####Text Processing
Examples for parsing text. Working with text files, using Java's BufferedReader, etc.

####Android
Collection of Android examples, though may not work so well with updates to the Android SDK. Clean and simple methods to interface with the Android API, especially for reading the sensors, generating audio, GPS, etc.
